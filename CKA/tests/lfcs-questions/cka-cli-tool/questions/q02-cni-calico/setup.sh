# Q2 — Install CNI Plugin (Calico): Setup
# No specific setup needed — this question uses the playground cluster as-is.
# The cluster should have nodes in NotReady state (no CNI installed).

echo "This question assumes a fresh Kubernetes cluster without a CNI plugin."
echo "If your cluster already has a CNI installed, nodes will be Ready."

echo "Your tasks:"
echo "  1. Choose a CNI that supports NetworkPolicy enforcement"
echo "  2. Install from manifest"
echo "  3. Ensure all nodes become Ready"
